  <p><i>Click <a href="http://www.engphys.ubc.ca/">here</a> for the offical Engineering Physics website.</i></p>
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: justify"> Engineering Physics is an accredited engineering degree program offered at the University of British Columbia. Often referred to as the most difficult program on campus,
    students in Engineering Physics take a total of 177 credits over the course of their degree. It is the most competitive engineering major to get into in second year, since students have to complete the regular application,
    as well as go through a series of entrance interviews. Core courses are in Computer Engineering (my favourite!), Electrical Engineering,
    Mechanical Engineering,  Physics, and Math. Alongside the core courses in my degree, this year I am taking the following technical electives:</p>
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: left">- <i>(1st term)</i> MATH 220 (Math Proofs)</p>
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: left">- <i>(2nd term)</i> CPSC 221 (Algorithms and Data Structures)</p>
  <!-- <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: justify">Some of the technical electives that I am looking forward to taking in the next two years of my degree are:</p>
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: left">- PHYS 402 (Applications of Quantum Mechanics)</p>
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: left">- CPSC 314 (Computer Graphics)</p>
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: left">- CPSC 526 (Computer Animation)</p> -->

  <h1>Engineering Undergraduate Society</h1>
  <img src = "../photos/eus.jpg" class="image img-responsive bot-margin" style="display:inline" width="30%">
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: justify">This year is my first year holding an Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) volunteer position,
    as <b>Logistics Manager</b> for the UBC Engineering Competition. My duties include recruiting and organizing chairs and judges for the various events
    in the competition, managing inventory, booking rooms, creating the competition schedule, and helping run the events. This year's competition
    will be held on October 14 at the University of British Columbia campus.</p>

  <h1>Godiva Band</h1>
  <img src = "../photos/godiva.jpg" class="image img-responsive bot-margin" style="display:inline" width="30%">
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: justify">The Godiva Band is UBC Engineering's marching band, which plays at a variety of engineering and
    sporting events throughout the academic year. In middle school and high school I was a member of multiple bands. I used to play in my
    school's concert band, an inter-school wind ensemble, my high school's wind ensemble, the marching band at my Air Cadet squadron, and I was a
    member of both the junior and senior jazz bands at my high school. When I arrived at UBC I was excited to find out that a musical
    community exists within engineering. I have been playing trumpet with the Godiva Band since first year.</p>

  <h1>Alpha Omega Epsilon</h1>
  <img src = "../photos/aoe.jpg" class="image img-responsive bot-margin" style="display:inline" width="30%">
  <p style="padding: 0 30%; text-align: justify">Alpha Omega Epsilon (AOE) is a professional engineering sorority that promotes friendship, leadership,
    and professionalism for women in engineering. I joined AOE in my first year at UBC and have been an active member for all of my academic terms to date.
    Last year I was co-chair of Fundraising and Philanthropy for the sorority. In that position, I helped to plan various events, including a joint charitable
    clothing drive between AOE and Gears and Queers, UBC Engineering's LGBTQA+ organization (which I was secretary for in the first term of my second year).</p>
